- **Title:** An Introduction to Distributed Tracing
- **Date:** 2018-11-24
- **Location:** Moscow, Russia

## Abstract

With the rise of single-page web apps and micro service architectures,
web applications are becoming increasingly complex. The old tools with
which we used to monitor the performance of monolith applications are no
longer sufficient. To better understand how data is flowing between the
different components of your application and to detect the bottlenecks
before it’s too late, you need a new set of tools to monitor the whole
stack - enter Distributed Tracing.

This talk will focus on what Distributed Tracing is, how to roll it out
across your infrastructure, and how to use it to gain better insights
and fix problems.

This talk aims to give the listener a better understanding of
Distributed Tracing and why it’s important. It will focus on the
OpenTracing standard developed to make your monitoring solution
vendor-neutral, and will use examples from Elastic APM - the newest open
source project coming to the Elastic Stack.
